Open Sustainability Index

### In brief
Open Sustainability Index is a global, free and open-source sustainability database, akin to Wikipedia, where anyone can view, report, and edit data.

The goal of the platform is to democratize and make sustainability data from all the world’s companies accessible to accelerate the transition.

### Our Vision 
Our vision is a future where every individual and organization has unimpeded access to the sustainability data they need to make informed decisions and contribute meaningfully to the planet’s health and society’s wellbeing.

We see a world where transparency reigns, where every impact is disclosed and accounted for, and where information is the foundation of accountability and transformation.

We envision a community united by shared facts and a commitment to act, propelling humanity towards a more sustainable and equitable existence.

### Our Mission 
In a world where humanity faces multiple global challenges, our mission is to democratize sustainability data.

We strive to make this vital information accessible and comparable for all – empowering individuals, communities, and organizations to make informed decisions. 

Our goal is to cultivate a global, open-source database akin to a “Wikipedia for sustainability data” — one that serves not only the public but also the private sector. 

By offering easily accessible, transparent, verifiable, and comparable sustainability data, we believe that we can drive collective action and advance the transition towards a more sustainable future.

The platform is the common ground for action, providing the transparency necessary to compare advances, impacts, hold entities accountable, and making informed decisions.

Through a collaborative, open-source database, we want to ensure that every data point counts towards the greater goal of a sustainable economy.

### Who We Are 
We are an open community, hosted and supported by [Our Commons Foundation](http://ourcommons.foundation/), a non-governmental and non-profit organization committed to future-proofing our planet for future generations, stopping climate change, and accelerating the transition to a sustainable society.

The database is not just a collection of data; it is a call to arms for the environment, an invitation to every global citizen to engage, contribute, and enhance our common understanding of climate and social impact.

### Read and Write Access 
Our database thrives on the principle of collective wisdom, drawing data from the open web. 

The platform enables companies to self-report and verify their sustainability data, offering a space where community-edited content meets corporate transparency. 

We operate on a model where verified data stands alongside community contributions, creating a tapestry of information that is as comprehensive as it is trustworthy. 

Anyone can contribute and report data, and anyone can access it. That’s the foundation of the platform.
